# 📊 Business Trends & Forecasting in Vancouver  
### UBC DSCI DataQuest 2025 — Team Saya Very Mager (SVM)

This repository contains our complete analytical pipeline for the DataQuest 2025 competition.  
We analyze **Vancouver’s business licence data from 1997–2025**, quantify the impact of COVID-19, evaluate long-term business survival, and forecast sector- and neighborhood-level activity for **2026–2035** using a weighted ensemble of modern forecasting models.

# 📝 Abstract

Vancouver’s business ecosystem experienced significant disruption during COVID-19, with highly uneven recovery across sectors. Using 28 years of business-licence data, we built an end-to-end pipeline combining **EDA**, **COVID impact quantification**, **Kaplan–Meier survival analysis**, and a **multi-model ensemble forecaster**.  
Our results identify which industries show long-term resilience, which sectors require strategic pivots, and where future business growth is likely to concentrate geographically.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

**Goal:** Determine which types of businesses will grow, remain stable, or decline in Vancouver over the next decade.

We address:
- Long-term sector trends (1997–2025)  
- COVID-19 disruption + recovery  
- Business longevity by industry  
- Forecasts for 11 sectors × 22 neighborhoods (2026–2035)

# 🧠 Methodology Overview

### **1. Data Preparation**
- Combined all datasets (1997–2012, 2013–2024, 2024–present)  
- Standardized categories (80+ → 12 major sectors)  
- Built unique business identifiers  
- Created COVID phase labels (pre, during, post)  
- Aggregated by LocalArea × BusinessType × Year  

### **2. EDA & Geographic Analysis**
- New vs. active business trends  
- Long-term sector shifts  
- Deck.gl neighborhood-level mapping  

### **3. COVID-19 Impact & Recovery**
Using formulas from slide 8: :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Impact %** = Change during COVID vs. pre-COVID  
- **Recovery %** = Change post-COVID vs. during COVID  

### **4. Survival Analysis (Kaplan–Meier)**
- Estimated business longevity curves for all 12 sectors  
- Identified sectors with highest long-term survival probabilities  

### **5. Forecasting Framework (2026–2035)**
Using a weighted ensemble (slide 14–15):
| Model | Weight | Purpose |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **PatchTST** | 30% | Transformer for long-horizon trends |
| **N-BEATS** | 30% | Robust for short series |
| **CatBoost** | 30% | Strong tabular ML with lag features |
| **Naive** | 10% | Stable baseline for sparse annual data |

### **6. Outputs**
- Forecasts for all BusinessType × LocalArea pairs  
- Sector-level and neighborhood-level projections
